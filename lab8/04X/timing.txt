1. For arrays, prepending is much slower than appending.

	list -> 100 0 10000 0
	array -> 100 0 10000 0

	Expected: Array to be much slower than the list wile prepending
	Results: 
		list = 0.07s
		array = 0.44s
	Analysis: Array is 5 times slower in prepending than lists.


2. For lists, prepending and appending are roughly the same speed.



3. Prepending is much faster in the list implementation than in the array implementation.



4. Appending is roughly the same speed for both implementations.
